      "## Strengths\n",
      "- **Scoring Ability:** Nathan stands out in his ability to score non-penalty goals, with a per 90 statistic of 0.51, placing him in the 98th percentile. His non-penalty expected goals (npxG) is also high at 0.35 per 90, ranked in the 94th percentile, which suggests that his high scoring rate is sustainable and not based on luck.\n",
      "- **Shot Volume:** He demonstrates a notable propensity to take shots, averaging 2.94 shots per 90, positioning him in the 87th percentile among peers. This trait indicates his confidence and willingness to create scoring opportunities.\n",
      "- **Defensive Contributions:** Broadhead shows an above-average ability to contribute defensively for an attacking player, evidenced by his blocks per 90 minutes at 1.37, ranking him in the 90th percentile.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Weaknesses\n",
      "- **Creating for Others:** Despite being effective in front of goal, Broadhead shows limitations in his playmaking, with assists at 0.12 per 90 (28th percentile) and shot-creating actions at 3.10 per 90 (31st percentile). This indicates a potential area for improvement in terms of creating opportunities for teammates.\n",
      "- **Lack of Involvement in Build-up Play:** His relatively low number of passes attempted per 90 at 26.29, ranking him in the 14th percentile, combined with average pass completion at 75.2% (60th percentile), suggests that he might not be heavily involved in passing or build-up phases of play.\n",
      "- **Progressive Playmaking:** Nathan has room to improve in progressive passes and carries, with respective percentiles of 36 and 29. Enhancing these areas could make him a more dynamic threat in advanced positions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Summary\n",
      "Nathan Broadhead is a dynamic forward-midfielder known for his exceptional goal-scoring ability and regular shot-taking, making him a significant threat in the attacking third. However, his ability to contribute to team play through assists and progressive actions is less impressive, indicating that he works best in a system where he can focus predominantly on finishing rather than creation. His defensive metrics suggest a willingness to contribute to team efforts beyond attacking, adding value to his profile. Broadhead could be a beneficial addition to teams needing a proven goal scorer who can independently create chances, but may not fit as well in a system that heavily relies on intricate build-up play or collective attacking movements.\n"
